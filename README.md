# SingleDetailFragment
[Showcase]

Modified version of iMet-raywenderlich- that uses one screen only to add, edit and view items
Additionally, it has been modified to accomodate:
  1. Koin DI
  2. DataBinding for DetailsFragment
  3. Moved most of the view logic into ViewModel
  4. Edit, add and view operations are unified into one "detail" screen only
